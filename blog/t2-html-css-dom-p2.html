    <h3>What is grid based design?</h3>
      <p>Grid based design involves breaking the webpage up into rows and columns, usually 12 columns. This makes placing elements on the page much easier because we can assign the element a size by assigning it a class which references the amount of rows or columns.

    <h3>What's all the hype around responsive webpages?</h3>
      <p>These days most people access websites via several different types of screens (laptops, tablets, smartphones etc). So, webpages need to be responsive, meaning they will be able to be viewed and accessed properly on any type of screen.

    <h3>What is semantic structure?</h3>
      <p>Semantic tags are those like h1, img etc, which act more as a logical reference to the type of code within it, as opposed to a structural tag like div or span.
