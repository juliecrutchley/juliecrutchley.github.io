      <h3>What is a responsive site and why is responsiveness important?</h3>
      <p>
        Responsiveness refers to a website that will 'respond' to the screen size it is being viewed on, i.e. if a mobile screen is being used, it will respond by altering the layout to best fit that screen. For a mobile screen, it might minimize image and text sizing to fit better and collapse large menus to allow you to easily view and navigate the site.<br>
        Responsiveness is vital for websites, now that it is common for users to access the web via multiple different screen sizes every day, i.e. on larger screens at work, on laptop screens at home, and on mobile screens throughout the day.
      </p>
      <h3>What is mobile first design and why is this important?</h3>
      <p>
        Mobile first design refers to starting the design process of a website with the mobile display design first. As the mobile screen is the smallest, the design will be the most basic, showcasing the most important elements of the site. Think of it as an elevator pitch for a business - it has to be short, sharp and have all the important stuff in a small space.<br>
        It is important to start with this first and then branch out to the design of the larger screen sizes because then you can expand on elements, menus, add more images etc. If you try to design the website from largest to smallest, you will end up trying to cram too much content into the smaller area.
      </p>
      <h3>What are frameworks and what are their pros and cons?</h3>
      <p>
        Frameworks are awesome! They are pre-formatted files with basic website content and styling settings already set up which can be used as a base on which to begin building a website. Think of them as a master blueprint for a basic house which an architect could re-use again and again, by then altering the number of rooms, floors, windows etc.
      </p>
      <h3>What is a wireframe and why do we use them?</h3>
      <p>
        A wireframe is a basic sketch of the layout of a site, often scribbled with pen and paper to quickly create several layout options. The layout is usually setout with 12 columns and basic boxes, in reference to how the HTML code would need to be written.<br>
        They are usually created without any text, colors or any major styling in an effort to not be distracted by those factors and just focus on the 'bare bones' of the website.
      </p>
      <h3>What aspects of wireframes did you find difficult to implement and why?</h3>
      <p>
        Aligning the images as per the wireframes posed the most difficult task, they kept wanting to overflow into other areas. Got them into line in the end!
      </p>
      <p>
        You can see below the wireframes I created when initially designing this site. You'll note I created wireframes for both the mobile view and desktop view. They look slightly different to the end product due to some changes made during the creation process!<br>I used <a href="https://www.sketchapp.com/">Sketch</a> to create these wireframes because I was interested in learning how to use it.
