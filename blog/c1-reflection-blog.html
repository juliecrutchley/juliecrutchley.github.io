      <h3>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h3>
      <p>Well, I'm only on my third day of the first phase of the course, but so far I am loving it.<br>
        Am I feeling like Alice delving into several scary rabbit holes every hour? Yes.<br>But that's what makes this all so exciting. There is <strong>so</strong> much to learn.But that's why I signed up to EDA, to show me the way!
      </p>
      <h3>What are your impressions?</h3>
      <p>
        So far, great! The tutors and the others in my cohort have been friendly and helpful.<br>There are so many resources out there to learn web dev but the ones EDA have so far compiled for me to read all seem really relevant.<br>I absolutely love their focus on a holistic learning environment, identifying that yes, this can be a stressful situation, and providing options to help with this.<br>
        <em>Stress ain't good for anyone!</em>
      </p>
      <h3>How do you see yourself engaging in this type of culture?</h3>
      <p>
        I love being able to bounce ideas off people with different styles, opinions and strengths. So, I think pretty well!
      </p>
      <h3>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</h3>
      <p>
        Not really, I did a lot of research into EDA and other bootcamps before jumping in, so I had a bit of an idea of what to expect.</p>
      <h3>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, definitely. I can see that in this kind of environment, you get out what you put in, which is both hugely motivating and exciting.</p>
      <h3>Does it make you nervous?</h3>
      <p>
        Absolutely. That's a good thing, right?
