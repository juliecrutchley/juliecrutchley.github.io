    <h2>What's your take on the EDA experience?</h2>
      <p>Well, I'm only on my third day of the first phase of the course, but so far I am loving it.
      Am I feeling like Alice delving into several scary rabbit holes every hour? Yes.
      But that's what makes this all so exciting. There is so much to learn.
      But that's why I signed up to EDA, to show me the way!
      </p>
    <h2>What are your impressions?</h2>
      <p>
      So far, great! The tutors and the others in my cohort have been friendly and helpful.
      There are so many resources out there to learn web dev but the ones EDA have so far compiled
      for me to read all seem really relevant.
      I absolutely love their focus on a holistic learning environment, identifying that yes, this can be a stressful
      situation, and providing options to help with this.
      <em>Stress ain't good for anyone!</em>
      </p>
    <h2>How do you see yourself engaging in this type of culture?</h2>
      <p>I love being able to bounce ideas off people with different styles, opinions and strengths. So, I think pretty well!
      </p>
    <h2>Have your expectations of EDA changed?</h2>
      <p>Not really, I did a lot of research into EDA and other bootcamps before jumping in, so I had a bit of an idea
        of what to expect.</p>
    <h2>Are you excited to participate in this kind of learning environment?</h2>
      <p>Yes, definitely. I can see that in this kind of environment, you get out what you put in, which is both hugely
        motivating and exciting.</p>
    <h2>Does it make you nervous?</h2>
        <p>Absolutely. That's a good thing, right?</p>
