      <h3>Explain a time you got blocked on a simple problem</h3>
      <p>
        <em>What was the problem?</em><br>
        The exercise was to create a program which would print an 8x8 grid chessboard, using #s for black squares and blank spaces for white squares.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What problem solving techniques did you use?</em><br>
        I used several problem solving techniques to solve this issue as I hadn't quite mastered nested loops at the time!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> How did you feel throughout the process?</em><br>
        I felt very frustrated as I knew the program to write should be very simple. I also felt worried that I must have skimmed over the previous learning exercises and resources which explained the related concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> What did you learn?</em><br>
        I learned that it's OK to not know everything when you're just starting out, and that you will eventually figure it out! I also learned that, at least for me, waliking away from the exercise I am stuck on and returning the next day with a clear head, works really well!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What problem solving techniques did you use?</em><br>
        I used several problem solving techniques including pseudocoding, console.logging and good ol' Googling.
      </p>
      <p>
      <h3>Reflect on how confident you feel using these problem solving techniques and processes:</h3>
      <p>
        <em>Pseudocode</em><br>
        I have used this technique several times so far and it seems to work well for me. If I am approaching a complex exercise, I will begin by constructing a list of all the elements I think will need to be involved, i.e. loops, new lines, named variables, and then break the exercise down into small pieces of pseudocode to work on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Trying something</em><br>
        Sometimes tutu-ing with random things can be deceivingly helpful! Often if I think my code looks fairly correct, I will just change one small random part of the code and see what results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Rubber ducky method</em><br>
        Yes, I have used this method! I don't have a rubby ducky though, but the plant in my study suffices...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Reading error messages</em><br>
        This is also very helpful!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Console.logging</em><br>
        Again, this method is very helpful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Googling</em><br>
        Google is a great resource to use when learning to code. Every time I have resorted to having to google, the issue has been solved very quickly. It's also very reassuring to see that others have googled the same issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Asking your peers and coaches for help</em><br>
        I haven't needed to do much of this yet, but I definitely will if I need to.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Improving your process with reflection</em><br>
        This is very important, sometimes if I am reading or watching something, I will write down in my own words what I have just learnt.
      </p>
      <h3>Explain these functions in your own words:</h3>
      <p>
        <em>.map()</em><br>
        This method is used to take an existing array, call a function to do something on each of the items within that array, and create a new array with the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>.filter()</em><br>
        This method is used to take an existing array, apply a filter such as 'only those items starting with letter A' and create a new array with the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>.reduce()</em><br>
        This method reduces several numerical values in an array into one value.
      </p>
