      <h3>What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h3>
      <p>
        Mindfulness is paying full non-judgmental attention to the present moment and all of the influences around us.<br>Self-awareness is being aware of, and understanding, ourselves - our emotions, preferences, strengths, weaknesses, intuition, wisdom.<br>
        Training in mindfulness can help develop self awareness.
      </p>
      <h3>Try at least one of the self awareness practices from the chapter (Body Scan, Journaling).<br>What was your experience of it? How did you feel?</h3>
      <p>
        I have been practicing the Body Scan technique regularly with the <a href = https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app>Headspace app</a> and find it is incredibly useful to pick up on small signals from the body and addressing them before they become an issue.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you take away from the "My Emotions are Not Me" section?</h3>
      <p>
        This was a really interesting concept! What I took away from it is that we will constantly experience a myriad of emotions day in and day out. These emotions don't define us or become the 'description of our day', they are just a part of the bigger picture called 'Life'! We should mindfully acknowledge the emotions we are feeling and decide if we need to take action or just experience them and move on.
