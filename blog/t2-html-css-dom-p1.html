    <h3>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM?</h3>
      <p>Let's use the analogy of an outfit... bear with me and I apologise if this is wrong, the DOM is still unique to me!
      </p>


      <div class="dom-analogy">
        <div class="dom-analogy-image"><img src="../styles/media/pic-dom.png" alt="Outfit analogy"></div>
        <div class="dom-analogy-text">The HTML would be <em>the clothing items</em> that make up the outfit, i.e:
          <ul>
            <li>dress</li>
            <li>belt</li>
            <li>shoes</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The CSS would specify what those items will <em>look</em> like), i.e.:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>The dress will be yellow and knee length</li>
            <li>The belt will be blue</li>
          </ul>
          <p>The DOM (Document Object Model) would be a drawing of the outfit much like the one to the left.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
