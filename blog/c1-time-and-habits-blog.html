    <h3>Which timebox techniques did you try?</h3>
      <p>Meditation - I've been itching to try this for some time now, so this was a great opportunity to start.<br>
        I downloaded the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">Headspace</a> app and
        completed day one. It might only have been 10 minutes of sitting on my bed, but I really dug it.<br>
        With daily prompts to complete more, this could be the start of a great thing for me!<br>
        I also tried <a href="http://cirillocompany.de/pages/pomodoro-technique/">Pomodoro</a> - this technique was
          completely new to me, but man, it makes a lot of sense.
      </p>

    <h3>What did you find interesting?</h3>
      <p>There are so many techniques to improve the way we manage our time and create good habits.<br>
        Something that really stood out to me was
      <a href="http://io9.gizmodo.com/how-meditation-changes-your-brain-and-makes-you-feel-b-470030863">this post by
        George Dvorsky</a> in relation to the science behind meditation, and in particular, this statement:<br>
      <em><strong>"instead of trying to hack into the mind of God, Buddhists are trying to hack into their own mind to
        harness it under control".</em></strong><br>
        If we're spending all day trying to 'hack' into computers effectively, surely it would help to set aside a little
        time each day to hack into our own minds!
      </p>
    <h3>What worked for you?</h3>
      <p>Although I've only completed one mini-session, meditation really did seem to clear and refocus my mind.
      </p>
    <h3>Which will you experiment further with?</h3>
      <p>Definitely meditation and pomodoro. I can see a trip to Kmart in the near future to purchase a tomato kitchen
        timer (totally necessary right?) - any excuse to go to Kmart...<br>
        I'd also like to look further into the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flow_(psychology)">flow technique</a>,
        perhaps I can complete one pomodoro per week on flow
        research.</p>
