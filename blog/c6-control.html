      <h3>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h3>
      <p>
        After reflecting on this, I've realised my main trigger while learning to code is when I am presented with an exercise where I initially feel I have absolutely no idea where to even start. I think this triggers me because prior to learning code I worked in the same industry for a long time so I am not used to being presented with tasks where I'm not already a master of the basics! What this triggers is a sense of insecurity about whether I will be able to complete the bootcamp and also triggers a worrying feeling of 'should I already know this'?!<br>
        What causes a disproportionate emotional response is when my code doesn't work and I spend a long time checking out the complex components of the code, only to find that the issue was something as small as a letter in the incorrect case!
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)?</h3>
      <p>
        I think 'stop and breathe' is something everyone is aware of, right? Whether it is physical pain after a minor burn to the hand or emotional discomfort such as an overwhelming sense of anger towards the person we are speaking to, a natural response is to 'take a few deep breaths'. However, that's usually where we stop and think everything should be fixed. This concept (very logically) expands on the further steps necessary after those deep breaths to effectively deal with the situation. I will be attempting to apply this in daily life, in particular 'noticing' the emotion - by identifying it with a name, then attempting to understand why I am experiencing that emotion.
