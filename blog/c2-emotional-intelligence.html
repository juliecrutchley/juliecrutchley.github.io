    <h3>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h3>
      <p>The main thing I took away from the first chapter of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062116924?ref_=smi_www_rco2_go_smi_2609328962&%2AVersion%2A=1&%2Aentries%2A=0&ie=UTF8&pldnSite=1">Search inside yourself</a> by Chade-Meng Tan was that the brain is trainable much like the body.<br>In the same way that you can train your body to be able to perform a backflip, you can train your mind to be able to read and interpret emotions more effecively and even to control your own. Awareness of your emotions and of those around you can improve both your professional and personal life.
      </p>

    <h3>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</h3>
      <p>As I have been continuing with the <a href="https://www.headspace.com/headspace-meditation-app">Headspace</a> course for meditation, I was already well aware of the multitude of benefits involved.<br>Another two minutes certainly didn't hurt!
