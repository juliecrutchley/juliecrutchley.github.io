      <h3>Have you tried any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h3>
      <p>
        In my view, trust is a hugely important factor in any relationship, whether it be with your family, friends, colleagues or even your doctor. So, I always work to build trust between myself and others.</br>
        Trust can be portrayed in many ways, as an example I trust my doctor to treat me with kindness, confidentiality and I also trust them to deliver a successful diagnosis and treatment.</br>
        When it comes to colleagues, it is important to trust that they will treat you with kindess and respect, and be open to your suggestions - as well as back the other way!
      </p>
      <h3>Try empathetic listening - how did it go?</h3>
      <p>
        I have been consciously working on my listening techniques since the earlier exercises and although I've not yet formally tried this technique I actually think it will be very helpful in two ways.</br>
        For one, I have often found myself in a situation where I have taken offence to what someone is saying to me, and this technique would remind myself to mindfully bring to my attention that this person may not have intended such offence.</br>
        And also, I think this will be helpful when I am conversing with others to remember that I should always speak to and treat everyone the same way I would like to be treated.
      </p>
      <h3>How did you find the loving kidness meditation?</h3>
      <p>
        This was a great exercise. I actually used my husband as the example and, although I already know he is a fantastic person, it reminded me that when we might be having a disagreement, a very important thing to remember is that we both just want each other (and ourselves) to be happy. The intent is never to make the other unhappy.

      <h3>Complete the political awareness exercise here in writing</h3>
      <p>
        <em>The situation:</em></br>
        My direct manager at a previous workplace left to go on maternity leave and their replacement (who was supposed to be training and mentoring me) was less experienced than me.</br></br>
        <em>My perspective</em></br>
        This situation is unfair as I took, and stayed in, this role on the provision that I would be trained and mentored to later move into a manager role. My manager should be training me and I should not be completing their work and also fixing their mistakes. I should have been considered for the manager role as my experience far outweighs their outdated qualification. She does not work as hard as I do.</br></br>
        <em>Their perspective</em></br>
        I have just started this new role and am struggling so far to learn the ropes and processes. I have the relevant qualification, however I have not practiced in this field and at this level for some time. My direct employee has a lot more experience in this particular situation and she is probably gunning for my job. I need more time to be able to prove myself. I have not been given enough support, I feel overwhelmed and sometimes I'm having to ask for help from my employee. I also can't work as late as they do every night because I take public transport - so I fear that might be looked upon as not putting in enough effort.
