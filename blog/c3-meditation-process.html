      <h3>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the redesign and build?</h3>
      <p>
        Being a perfectionist, this was a concept I had to keep reinforcing with the redesign project.
      </p>
      <h3>What did you think about meditation before reading Chapter 2?</h3>
      <p>
        I was really interested in meditation before starting to read the book, and was completely hooked after reading Chapter 1. I knew it had calming benefits, but I actually was very unaware of some of the more tangible physical benefits.
      </p>
      <h3>What new things have you learned about meditation?</h3>
      <p>
        I have learned much more about the possible mental and physical benefits from meditation. The example of psoriasis sufferers seeing improvement with meditation is incredible.
      </p>
      <h3>Did any of the suggested meditation techniques stand out to you?</h3>
      <p>
        The technique of keeping your eyes half closed stood out to me and is something that I am going to try!
